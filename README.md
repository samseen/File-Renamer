The codes in the program are random files that work together to rename files in subfolders. It was used to work on an hospital patient records. Each patients has a folder. And each folder has 10 subfolders. Each subfolder eventually contains files of the patient. 

Where it gets interesting is that for each patient files, they will need to be named according to a specific taxonomy. This program iterates each patient's folder and finds the last file which it then renames according to the set taxonomy set for each folder.
